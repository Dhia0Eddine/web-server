# HDE Lightweight C++ Web Server

Welcome! This is **my personal educational project** to **build a real, functioning HTTP web server from scratch in C++** to deeply understand how networking, HTTP parsing, concurrency, and clean system design work.

---

## What is this project?

It's a **tiny but complete web server** that:

- Accepts **HTTP requests** with full **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE** method support.
- Parses the request to extract **method, path, headers, body**.
- Uses a **Router** with method-specific routing and convenient helper methods.
- Builds and sends back **clean HTTP responses** with proper status codes and headers.
- Uses a **ThreadPool** to handle **multiple clients concurrently**.
- Implements **graceful shutdown** with signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTERM).
- Uses **smart pointers** for memory safety and RAII principles.

All using **pure C++ and raw sockets** (no external HTTP libraries), so you learn **exactly what's happening under the hood.**

---

## How does this web server work?

Here's the **life cycle of a client request:**

1. **Socket Creation**:
- We create a TCP socket using `socket()`.
- We bind it to a port (`8080`) and `INADDR_ANY` so it listens on all interfaces.
- We start `listen()` to wait for clients.

2. **Signal Handling**:
- The server registers handlers for `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) and `SIGTERM` for graceful shutdown.
- When received, the server stops accepting new connections and cleans up resources.

3. **Accepting Connections**:
- When a client connects, the server calls `accept()` to get a **new socket** representing that client.

4. **ThreadPool Handling**:
- Instead of blocking the server for one client, we push the connection to a **ThreadPool**.
- The pool has a fixed number of worker threads, each picking up client connections and handling them in parallel.

5. **Connection Handling**:
- Each connection reads the raw HTTP request into a buffer.
- We parse it into an `HTTPRequest` object with `method`, `path`, `headers`, `body`.

6. **Method-Aware Routing**:
- The `Router` looks at both the **HTTP method** and **path** to decide which handler function to call.
- Support for `GET /users`, `POST /users`, `PUT /users/1`, `DELETE /users/1` with different handlers.
- The handler generates a `RouteResult` with:
  - Status code (`200`, `404`, `201`, etc.)
  - Status text (`OK`, `Created`, `Not Found`)
  - Body content
  - Content-Type
  - Additional headers (if needed)

7. **Responding**:
- We convert the `RouteResult` into a full HTTP response string (`HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n...`).
- We send it back to the client with `write()`.
- We close the client socket, freeing resources.

## New Features & Improvements

### Memory Management & Resource Safety
- Smart Pointers: `SimpleServer` now uses `std::unique_ptr` instead of raw pointers
- RAII: Automatic cleanup of sockets and resources
- Exception Safety: Proper error handling without memory leaks

### Graceful Shutdown
- Signal Handling: Responds to `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) and `SIGTERM`
- Clean Termination: Stops accepting new connections and finishes processing existing ones
- Resource Cleanup: Properly closes sockets and joins threads

### Full HTTP Method Support
- GET: For retrieving resources
- POST: For creating new resources
- PUT: For updating existing resources
- DELETE: For removing resources

### Enhanced Router
- Method-Specific Routing: Different handlers for same path but different methods
- Convenience Methods: `router.get()`, `router.post()`, `router.put()`, `router.delete_()`
- Backward Compatibility: Still supports old string-based handlers

### Configuration System
- File-Based Configuration: Uses `server.conf` file for easy customization
- Runtime Defaults: Sensible defaults when config file is missing
- Flexible Settings: Configure port, thread pool size, timeouts, and more
- Comment Support: Configuration file supports comments and various formats
- Type Safety: Automatic type conversion for strings, integers, and booleans


---

## Configuration

The server can be configured using a `server.conf` file. If no configuration file is provided, the server will use sensible defaults.

### Sample Configuration File (`server.conf`):
```ini
# HDE Web Server Configuration File
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Format: key = value

# Server Settings
server.port = 8080
server.host = 0.0.0.0
server.backlog = 10

# Thread Pool Settings
threadpool.size = 4

# Logging Settings
logging.level = INFO
logging.enabled = true

# Performance Settings
server.timeout = 30
server.max_connections = 100

# Security Settings
server.enable_cors = true
server.cors_origin = *

# Static File Settings
static.enabled = false
static.root_dir = ./public
static.index_file = index.html

# Development Settings
dev.hot_reload = false
dev.debug = false
```

### Configuration Options:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `server.port` | 8080 | Port number for the server to listen on |
| `server.backlog` | 10 | Maximum number of pending connections |
| `threadpool.size` | 4 | Number of worker threads in the thread pool |
| `server.timeout` | 30 | Connection timeout in seconds |
| `server.max_connections` | 100 | Maximum concurrent connections |
| `logging.level` | INFO | Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) |
| `logging.enabled` | true | Enable/disable logging |

### Usage:
```bash
# Use default configuration
./web_server

# Use custom configuration file
./web_server custom.conf
```

---

## Building and Running

### 1. Clone and enter the directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dhia0Eddine/web-server.git
cd web-server
```

### 2. Build with CMake:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### 3. Configure the server (optional):
```bash
# Copy the sample configuration file
cp ../server.conf .

# Edit the configuration file
nano server.conf
```

### 4. Run the server:
```bash
./web_server
```

### 5. Graceful shutdown:
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C or send SIGTERM
kill -TERM <process_id>
```

---

## Testing All HTTP Methods

### Using curl:
```bash
# GET requests
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/hello
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/users

# POST requests
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "secret"}'

# PUT requests
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/users/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Bob Updated", "email": "bob@updated.com"}'

# DELETE requests
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/users/1
```

### Using JavaScript (Browser Console):
```javascript
// GET request
fetch('http://localhost:8080/hello')
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(data => console.log(data));

// POST request
fetch('http://localhost:8080/users', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com'})
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```
