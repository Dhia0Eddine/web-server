// this file includes all socket-related classes and functions
// It includes the SimpleSocket, BindingSocket, ConnectingSocket, and ListeningSocket classes
// These classes provide a simple interface for creating and managing sockets in C++
// The SimpleSocket class is the base class for all socket types
// The BindingSocket class is used for binding sockets to addresses and ports
// The ConnectingSocket class is used for connecting sockets to remote addresses
// The ListeningSocket class is used for listening for incoming connections on a socket
